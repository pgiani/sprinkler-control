## What is this and who is it for ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

This is just a work assignment where I had to:

- Create an application without the use of pre-built solutions such as Create React
- Using Rachio's public API, run all a device's zones or specified zones for a set amount of time

## Features

- Build using WebPack 4, took some time to get all configure correctly
- Use ReactJs Hooks
- Image caching to improve user experience
- Cache API responses to again improve user experience
- Deploy App to GitPages, had to create a different WebPack configuration for the deployment
- Automates scripts for dev, build, test and deploy

## Desing Choices

- Due to the limit time there is no server code, we are pulling for changes when need it
- Use of time deltas insted of dates when informing the user the Zone was last activated, exemple use Yesterday, an hour ago, etc instad of 1/27/2020 14:00pm
- Hit with colors, if a zones is disable or ready to got
- Cachec images and previus API responses in order to speed page paint
- Ssome support for mobile, more is need it

## Setting up development environment üõ†

- clone the repo and change directory to ./sprinkler-control
- `npm run install`
- `npm run dev`
- The app should now be running on `http://localhost:8080/`

## Tests üö•

- change directory to ./sprinkler-control
- `npm run test`

## Build ‚õ¥

- change directory to ./sprinkler-control
- `npm run build`

## Deploy to GitHub Pages ‚õµ

The app is deploy to gitPages but there are some issues with react-router and the way GitHub Pages deals with Urls, the app runs but you must click on devices to get it started, I did not had the time to fix the issue. you can see it live by visiting the URL below an clicking on "Devices"

## What's missing?

Everything pretty much, this was a 4-hour sprint to get some basic API call working

### Proper authentication system üîê

Currently there is none

### Accessibility ‚ôø

Not all components have properly defined [aria attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA), visual focus indicators, etc. Most early-stage companies tend to ignore this aspect of their product but in many cases, they shouldn't, especially once their userbase starts growing.

### Unit/Integration tests üß™

Very little to no testing has been done due to the very limited time allowed to this implementation. However, as the app grows in complexity, it might be wise to start writing additional unit/integration tests.
